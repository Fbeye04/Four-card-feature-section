### What I learned

Hereâ€™s a description that highlights what you learned about using SASS/SCSS while working on the four card section project:

One of the most significant lessons I gained from working on the four card section project was mastering the use of SASS/SCSS. Implementing SASS/SCSS allowed me to write more efficient and maintainable styles. By leveraging features like variables, mixins, and nesting, I was able to reduce repetition and make the codebase cleaner and more modular. For example, I used variables to manage color schemes and font sizes across the project, ensuring consistency and simplifying future changes. Mixins allowed me to reuse common patterns like flexbox layout and media queries, further streamlining my workflow. Overall, learning how to use SASS/SCSS effectively has improved my understanding of CSS architecture and enhanced my productivity when building responsive and scalable layouts.
